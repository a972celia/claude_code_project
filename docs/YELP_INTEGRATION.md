# 🟡 Yelp Data Integration for AI-Powered Underwriting Engine

## 📋 Overview

The Yelp integration system enhances loan underwriting models by incorporating external business reputation and sentiment data from Yelp's vast business directory and review database. This adds crucial alternative data sources that can improve risk assessment accuracy.

## 🎯 Business Value

### **Enhanced Risk Assessment**
- **Business Reputation**: Yelp ratings and reviews provide insights into business quality and customer satisfaction
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Review sentiment analysis reveals customer perception and potential business issues
- **Establishment Longevity**: Review counts and business engagement metrics indicate business stability
- **Category Risk**: Industry-specific risk factors (restaurants, bars have higher failure rates)

### **Alternative Data Sources**
- **Reduces Information Asymmetry**: Provides data on businesses that may not have extensive credit history
- **Real-Time Insights**: Current business reputation vs. historical financial data
- **Geographic Intelligence**: Location-specific business performance patterns
- **Market Validation**: Customer demand and satisfaction indicators

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Core Components**

1. **YelpDataCollector**: Handles API interactions, rate limiting, and data caching
2. **YelpFeatureEngineer**: Transforms raw Yelp data into ML-ready features
3. **YelpDataPipeline**: End-to-end integration with loan preprocessing
4. **EnhancedLoanDataPreprocessor**: Extends base preprocessor with external data

### **Data Flow**
```
Raw Loan Data → Business Info Extraction → Yelp API Search → 
Business Details + Reviews → Sentiment Analysis → Feature Engineering → 
Enhanced Model Training
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **API Configuration**
```python
from config.yelp_config import yelp_config

# Method 1: Environment Variable
export YELP_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Method 2: Configuration File
echo "your_api_key_here" > config/yelp_api_key.txt
```

### **Basic Usage**
```python
from external_data.yelp_integration import YelpDataPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = YelpDataPipeline(api_key="your_api_key")

# Enhance loan dataset
enhanced_df = pipeline.enhance_loan_data(
    loan_df,
    business_name_col='business_name',
    location_col='business_location'
)
```

### **Enhanced Preprocessing**
```python
from data_pipeline.preprocessing.enhanced_preprocessor import EnhancedLoanDataPreprocessor

# Initialize with Yelp integration
preprocessor = EnhancedLoanDataPreprocessor(enable_yelp=True)

# Process with external data
X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocessor.preprocess_with_external_data(raw_df)
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### **Caching System**
- **Local Caching**: API responses cached for 24 hours
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/second max (well below Yelp's 5000/day limit)
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple loan applications

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing Yelp data doesn't break the pipeline
- **Fallback Features**: Empty features for unavailable data
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient API errors

### **Data Quality**
- **Business Matching**: Fuzzy matching for business name/location pairs
- **Sentiment Validation**: TextBlob sentiment analysis with error handling  
- **Feature Scaling**: All Yelp features standardized with existing pipeline

## 🎯 Expected Model Improvements

### **Predictive Power**
Based on correlation analysis of synthetic features:
- **Interest Rate Correlation**: Yelp features show expected negative correlation with loan risk
- **Default Prediction**: Business reputation metrics should improve AUC by 2-5%
- **Feature Importance**: Expect `yelp_reputation_score` and `yelp_poor_rating` in top 15 features

### **Model Interpretability**
- **SHAP Analysis**: Yelp features provide explainable risk factors
- **Regulatory Compliance**: External reputation data supports lending decisions
- **Customer Communication**: Clear rationale for loan decisions

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### **API Key Management**
- Environment variables preferred over config files
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Rotate keys regularly

### **Data Privacy**

   - Implement fuzzy matching or manual business ID mapping

3. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - Solution: Implement exponential backoff, reduce request frequency

4. **"Sentiment analysis failed"**
   - Solution: Install TextBlob corpora: `python -m textblob.download_corpora`

### **Performance Issues**
- **Slow API calls**: Increase batch sizes, implement parallel processing
- **Memory usage**: Process in chunks for large datasets
- **Cache misses**: Increase cache duration for stable business data
